## Visiting Address

We are located on Charité Campus Mitte just a short (&lt; 10 min) walk away from the main train station (Hauptbahnhof). The closest bus and tram stop is Invalidenpark. The closest S- and U-Bahn stop is Hauptbahnhof.

Our campus address is Virchowweg 20 but it is easiest to enter the building via Invalidenstraße 80. The two buildings are connected and you can find us on level 03 by following the signs to the BIH Core Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI).
